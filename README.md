## Cottage & Castle Overview:

At Cottage & Castle, we believe that cleaning is more than just a chore. It's a magical transformation that turns a messy and chaotic space into a beautiful and sparkling retreat. We use our cleaning powers to create a sense of wonder and enchantment in every home we clean.


Our team of skilled cleaners is like a group of fairy godmothers, bringing a touch of magic to every corner of your home. We wave our magic wands, and your living room becomes a cozy haven, your kitchen a place of delicious smells and warmth, and your bedroom a serene sanctuary.


Skillfully crafted using React and Vanilla Javascript technologies, Cottage & Castle has created a scheduling portal to assist clients in the tidying of their homes, petite and majestic alike. Clients are welcomed to request exactly which services they require, and can expect swift approval from our owner, [Seth Graves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethlgraves/), through the admin features of the application.

Schedule your next appointment with us today! It may not be magic, but I promise that our services will fulfill your every wish.
